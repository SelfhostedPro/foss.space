# Forum Website Development Plan

## Project Overview
We're building a forum website using TanStack Start, TanStack Router, TanStack Query, Shadcn components, and Drizzle ORM with LibSQL (Turso) as the database. The forum will focus on FOSS Development with a hybrid UI that combines elements of Twitter and Discourse, allowing users to follow people, have a personalized feed, maintain profile content, while also organizing discussions in a traditional forum structure.

The main app lives in apps/web.

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- Core platform with clear extension points
- Plugin-based modular design for extensibility
- Event-driven communication between core and plugins
- Clear boundaries between core and plugin functionality

### Database Structure
- Core schema in Drizzle ORM with LibSQL/Turso
- Plugin-specific tables with migration support
- Efficient schema design for nested structures

### Plugin Architecture
- Standardized plugin interface and lifecycle hooks
- Extension points for core features
- Event subscription model
- Plugin-specific storage and configuration
- Version compatibility management

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- Server functions for protected operations
- Event-based communication for plugins
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### State Management
- TanStack Query for server state management
- React hooks for local state
- Event bus for cross-component/plugin communication

### UI Components
- Shadcn components as the base UI library
- Custom components built on top as needed
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Component extension mechanisms for plugins

### Performance Considerations
- Pagination for lists of threads and posts
- Infinite scrolling for long threads
- Lazy loading of images and heavy content
- Optimistic UI updates
- Efficient handling of deeply nested data structures
- Plugin isolation for resource-intensive operations

## Principles
- Keep it simple - avoid over-engineering
- Progressive enhancement - start with core features and add complexity gradually
- Plugins over monolith - prefer extensibility over tightly-coupled features
- User-centered design - prioritize features based on user needs
- Mobile-first approach - ensure great experience on all devices
- Community focus - build features that enhance open source collaboration
